# Turing Machine

![Turing Machine](../images/turing.png)

This is a binary sequencer, based around a 16 bit memory circuit called a shift register. Itâ€™s designed as a sequencer
that you can steer in one direction or another, not one that you can program precisely. It is a kind of reproduction
of the Turing Machine by [Music Thing Modular](https://musicthing.co.uk/)

## Controls

* **Probability**: Set the probability of the Turing Machine
* **Length**: Set the length of the sequence

## Inputs

* **Gate**: The clock trigger

## Outputs

* **Gate**: same as the gate input
* **CV output**: The genereated note
* **2, 4, 6, 8, 2+4, 2+6**: When these steps of the shiftregister are set to '1' they are triggered
