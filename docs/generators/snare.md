# Snare

![Snare](../images/snare.png)

This is a module with a snare-sound. Internally it is build upon 2 oscillators, 2 envalopes, 1 noise and a gain. The waves used are a sine.
There's a little side-effect when turning the 'Decay' knob to minimal values. This is caused because the end of the decay is prior its start, so it wil never go to 0 again ðŸ˜Ž.

Inspiration for this module was gathered from this [article by MusicTech.net](https://www.musictech.net/tutorials/modular-eurorack-snare-tutorial/)

Other then in the article, this snare also uses an envelope for a small pitch sweep.
