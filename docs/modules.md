# Modules & Connections

## Modules

Like every modular synthesizer, also this one is build upon modules. Modules are grouped together by type. Every type has it's own color. This will make it a bit more easy to see what type of module it is. While every module has it's own functionallities, they all have some simularities:

* All the inputs are on the left side of the module
* All the outputs are on the right side of the module
* A module can be removed by 'right clicking' the header area. This will also remove all the connections to and from the module

## Connections

You can and have to connect modules together to make some music. There are 2 types of connections:

1. **Audio connections (*red*)**: for audio and cv values
1. **Gate connections (*blue*)**: for gate connections (these handle callback functions, so are not interchangable)

Connections can only be created from dragging an output of a module to an input of a module. The can be removed by right-clicking either the start or the end of the connection.
