# Usage

There are some basic usage things to take in account while using the SYnthZYGY modular

## Modules & Connections
* Modules can have multiple inputs and outputs. All the inputs are on the left side of the module and all the outputs are on the right side of the module.
* Connecting one module with another one can only by connecting the output to the input. The other way around does not work (yet)
* Connections can be removed by right-clicking the start or end of the connector
* Modules can be deleted by right-clicking the header area of a module. This will also remove it's connections


## Usability thingies
* Collision detection needs to be improved. While dragging modules around and 'hitting' another module, can feel a bit clumsy.
* If there are no options to drag a module around another one, you can drag it through other modules. Visualy you will see nothing, 'till there is room to place the module
