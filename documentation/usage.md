# Usage

There are some basic usage things to take in account while using the SYnthZYGY modular

* Modules can have multiple inputs and outputs. All the inputs are on the left side of the module and all the outputs are on the right side of the module.
* Connecting one module with another one can only by connecting the output to the input. The other way around does not work (yet)
* Collision detection needs to be improved. Whele dragging modules around and 'hitting' another module, can feel a bit clumsy.
* If there are no options to drag a module around another one, you can drag it through other modules. Visualy you will see nothing, 'till there is room to place the module
