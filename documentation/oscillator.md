# Oscillator (VCO)

<span style="margin-right: 1rem; float: left;">![Oscillator](./images/oscillator.png)</span>This Ooscillator is build with th ereal-life modular VCO in mind.
A voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO) is an electronic oscillator whose oscillation frequency is controlled by a voltage input. The applied input voltage determines the instantaneous oscillation frequency.

## Controls
* Octave: Set the base octave
* Frequency: Set the frequency to play. Disabled when the input is connected
* Detune: frequency finetunung
* FM: Set the amount of frequency modulation applied
* V/Oct (toggle button):
  * On: the full frequency range is controlled by the frequency control. The octave control has nu use here
  * Off: The frequency control controls only 1 octave. The octave control is used to set the octave
